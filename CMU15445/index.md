# CMU 15-445/645 - Database Systems
Taught by Prof. Andy Pavlo in Fall, 2019

## Course Description
This course is on the design and implementation of database management systems. 
Topics include data models (relational, document, key/value), storage models 
(n-ary, decomposition), query languages (SQL, stored procedures), storage 
architectures (heaps, log-structured), indexing (order preserving trees, hash 
tables), transaction processing (ACID, concurrency control), recovery (logging, 
checkpoints), query processing (joins, sorting, aggregation, optimization), and 
parallel architectures (multi-core, distributed). Case studies on open-source and 
commercial database systems are used to illustrate these techniques and trade-offs.
The course is appropriate for students with lit systems programming skills.
