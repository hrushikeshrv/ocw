# MIT 6.006 - Introduction to Algorithms
Taught by Prof. Erik Demaine, Prof. Srini Devadas in Fall, 2011

## Course Description
This course provides an introduction to mathematical modeling of 
computational problems. It covers the common algorithms, algorithmic 
paradigms, and data structures used to solve these problems. The course 
emphasizes the relationship between algorithms and programming, and 
introduces basic performance measures and analysis techniques for these 
problems.
