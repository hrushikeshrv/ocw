# MIT 6.045J - Automata, Computability, Complexity
Taught by Prof. Scott Aaronson

# Course Description
This course provides a challenging introduction to some of the central 
ideas of theoretical computer science. It attempts to present a vision 
of “computer science beyond computers”: that is, CS as a set of mathematical 
tools for understanding complex systems such as universes and minds. 
Beginning in antiquity, with Euclid’s algorithm and other ancient examples
of computational thinking, the course will progress rapidly through finite 
automata, Turing machines and computability, decision trees and other concrete 
computational models, efficient algorithms and reducibility, NP-completeness, 
the P versus NP problem, the power of randomness, cryptography and one-way 
functions, computational learning theory, interactive proofs, and quantum 
computing and the physical limits of computation. Class participation is 
important, as the class will include discussion and debate about many of these 
topics.
