# Decidability
An important theorem regarding Turing machines is that a Turing machine can simulate other Turing 
machines, which can potentially be more complicated than itself. That is, a Turing machine A can
act as an _interpreter_ for Turing machine B, and B can be much more complicated than A.

Alan Turing actually gave such an example of an interpreter in his 1936 paper, but it turned out to 
have a mistake, so he had to publish a correction in 1937. Regardless, it can be done.
