# Turing Machines
Alan Turing, in 1936, proposed a more powerful model of the finite automata, called the Turing machine
(On Computable Numbers, [A.M. Turing, 1936](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Turing_Paper_1936.pdf)).

A Turing machine is a finite automata which has the ability to read a symbol and transition to another
state, just like a DFA, but it can also write a symbol on the same paper it is reading from, and it
can further move the paper it is reading from either to the right or to the left. It turns out that
this model is powerful enough to be able to make arbitrary finite computations.
